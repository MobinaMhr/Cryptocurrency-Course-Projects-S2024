# Cryptocurrency-Course-Projects-S2024

Cryptocurrency course projects in the fall semester of the University of Tehran under the supervision of Dr.Shariatpanahi. 

## [CA1](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Cryptocurrency-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/CA1)

This assignment demonstrates the implementation of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption using Python's cryptography libraries. For symmetric encryption, the AES algorithm was utilized, while RSA was employed for asymmetric encryption. Additionally, RSA was applied to implement digital signatures.

## [CA2](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Cryptocurrency-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/CA2)

This assignment demonstrates several transactions on the Bitcoin testnet, including creating a basic transaction, a multi-signature transaction, and a password-protected transaction using Bitcoin Script.

In the second part, a local Ethereum network was set up using Geth, followed by mining some blocks.

## [Research Project](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Cryptocurrency-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Research)

My research project focused on FalconDB, a blockchain-based collaborative database. The paper is availabe in [this link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3318464.3380594). I've included both a detailed report and a presentation on the project.
